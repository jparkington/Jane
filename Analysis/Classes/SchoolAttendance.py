This script generates a randomized dataset of attendance records for students within a specific date range. The dataset can
be saved as a CSV file or used directly as a pandas DataFrame.

Schema:
    date (timestamp):     The date of the attendance record
    student_id (varchar): A unique identifier for each student
    attendance (boolean): A flag indicating whether the student attended school on the given date (True for attended, False for absent)

Data Constraints:
    Each student_id is represented across all dates and does not show up twice for the same date.
    The final DataFrame is ordered by date (ascending) and student_id (ascending).
    The number of rows is determined by the max_student_id â‹… time_delta, which ensures all students are accounted for across all days.

        Generate a list of dictionaries with randomized attendance data to be output as either a CSV file or a pandas DataFrame for immediate use.
        
        Considerations:
            Using two loops in this method ensures that we create a record for each student on each date.
            A dictionary is used for each attendance record because it allows for easy conversion to a pandas DataFrame later.
